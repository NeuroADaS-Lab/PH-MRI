# Persistent Homology and Brain Networks (MRI)

## Comparing multimodal brain networks to identify robust connectivity patterns using persistent homology in multiple sclerosis

Brain networks (or graphs) derived from magnetic resonance imaging have demonstrated a useful method to represent brain data organization. In this context, graph measures have been widely used as a methodology to represent and study topological brain properties. These measures are typically derived from graph theory and can provide insights into the organization, efficiency, and communication patterns of the brain network. This study proposes using persistent homology and Betti curves to extract relevant features identifying people with neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, from structural brain connectivity, morphological gray matter and functional brain networks. We compare the features extracted from each single- and multi-layer architecture, and prove that using a multi-layer architecture better preserves the brain alterations driving cognitive processes and brain damage. As a proof of concept, our framework was tested on a cohort of multiple sclerosis patients, demonstrating that features extracted using our proposed conceptual scheme can identify and classify both healthy controls and people with multiple sclerosis.
